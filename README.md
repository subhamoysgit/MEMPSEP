# MEMPSEP
Multivariate Ensemble of Models for Probabilistic forecast of Solar Energetic Particles
* End-to-End Deep Neural Network model-ensemble trained on remote sensing + in-situ dataset for forecast of SEP occurrence
* Usage of model ensemble maximizes the use of an imbalanced dataset and brings forecasting confidence with uncertainty estimates
* Calibration of model outcome to true probability optimizes the forecast reliability acting as a means to step away from the binary forecast
